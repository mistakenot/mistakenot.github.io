I'm a self taught software software nerd from the UK. Originally destined to be a Mechanical Engineer, a regrettable brush with adult life during my Gap Year gave me the conviction I needed to find a job that I could do from home in my PJ's, or whatever is closest to it.

I currently split my time between freelancing and building software products. Amateur pianist, gym-curious, occcasional scuba diver and sailor.
